# Getting Started in Computer Vision
#### Learn the Basics: https://roboflow.com/learn
### [Computer vision (also called machine vision)](https://blog.roboflow.com/intro-to-computer-vision/) is one of the most exciting frontiers in computing. With computer vision, anyone with the right skills can solve problems that used to take years of research to solve.
### You can build a model to detect defects in products, to identify wildfires, or to detect the wildlife in a given area. If a solution benefits from identifying or tracking objects in video or finding objects in an image, computer vision can be helpful. https://universe.roboflow.com/browse
