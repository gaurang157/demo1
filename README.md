## üíª run locally

```console
# clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
git clone git@github.com:roboflow-ai/streamlit-web-app.git
cd streamlit-web-app
cd streamlit

# setup python environment and activate it
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run Home.py
```

## Next Steps:
1. Customize the app further for your use case: https://docs.streamlit.io
2. Create another custom app or solution with your model
3. Create new models. Need inspiration? [Try searching Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com)
4. Getting false detections? Model not performing to your expectations? Try Active Learning (Smart Sampling) and improving your Dataset Health:
